# VA IT - Issue Tracker
### Organization of Verbal Autopsy IT related issues, requests and questions.

The Verbal Autopsy (VA) IT Tool community is currently engaged in discussions aimed at reconciling the multitude of tools available as part of a VA IT Tool Steering Group, using the World Health Organizationâ€™s Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based, and Testable (SMART) [Guidelines]([url](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines)) as a framework. These discussions also focus on future planning, including how best to align on a set of standard formats, processes, procedures, and definitions that can best push VA forward.

This repository will be a place to organize and triage issues, comments, and questions submitted by participating stakeholders to view, assign and manage issues, requests, and questions related to VA IT SMART guideline applications and products.  In its current form, this repository will hold the latest VA documentation such as the Verbal Autopsy Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) and the L3 Framework, and questions, comments, and change requests to these documents can be submitted and tracked via `Issues`.

_Versions of the L2 DAK and L3 will be forthcoming. This repository currently serves solely to gather and triage feedback._
